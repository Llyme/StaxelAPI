# StaxelAPI
Some helpful stuff to make code-based mods for Staxel.

### Requirements
0Harmony (Included in the releases.)

### Installment
Extract the files in `[Staxel Directory]\bin`.
Play.

## INI
A simple INI system with an automatic read-and-write when any value changes in both inside and outside the game.

## InputHelper
Check keyboard state, as well as a just-pressed key check.

## ModPlugin
A less bloated hook so you don't have to create all the functions that you won't be using.
